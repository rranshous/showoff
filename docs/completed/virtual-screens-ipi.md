## Introduce

What if we presented the model w/ virtual screens it could draw or put text on?

# Context
This is expiremental, exploratory work. keep it simple

### ✅ Completed Milestones

### ✅ Milestone 1: Add additional panel in VS Code
- Created VirtualScreensProvider webview provider class
- Added new view container "virtualscreens-sidebar" with desktop icon
- Registered virtualscreens.screensView in package.json views configuration  
- Updated extension.ts to register both canvas and virtual screens providers
- Extension compiles successfully with two separate panels available

**To test:** Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host. You should now see two icons in the activity bar - the original ShowOff canvas and the new Virtual Screens panel with a desktop icon.

### ✅ Milestone 2: Update new panel to show a web page
- Created dedicated virtual-screens.html file with professional structure and styling
- Updated VirtualScreensProvider to load HTML from file with proper error handling
- Added VS Code theme integration with consistent colors and typography
- Created screens-container layout ready for multiple virtual screens
- Implemented webview-extension communication foundation for future screen management
- Added placeholder content indicating readiness for screen management tool

**To test:** Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host. Click the Virtual Screens icon to see the professionally styled panel with header, screens container, and placeholder content ready for virtual screen implementation.

### ✅ Milestone 3: Update the webpage to have a virtual screen (text)
- Added first virtual text screen with proper HTML structure and styling
- Implemented JavaScript functions for screen management: updateTextScreen, createTextScreen, clearScreen
- Added VS Code theme-integrated styling for text screens with editor background and borders
- Created demo text screen showing concept with welcome content and instructions
