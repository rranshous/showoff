# Visual Copilot Extension - IPI

## Introduce

I want to give copilot more space for collaboration

Create a VSCode extension which hooks in a tool so that copilot can draw on a canvas in a side panel using a js function

## Project name
The project is named `showoff`. use that for any package names etc.

## Plan

### Technical 
Typescript

### Milestones
1. basic extension which has an activity button which opens a panel
2. Update the panel to show a web page
3. update the webpage to have a canvas and some random shapes
2. register a tool with copilot that takes a js function as arg and prints it to console
3. have the tool run the js function in the side panel and draw on the canvas
4. test and refine
