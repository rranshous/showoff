# Visual Copilot Extension - IPI

## Introduce

I want to give copilot more space for collaboration

Create a VSCode extension which hooks in a tool so that copilot can draw on a canvas in a side panel using a js function

## Plan

milestones:
1. basic extension with side panel and canvas showing a loading message
2. register a tool with copilot that takes a js function as arg and prints it to console
3. have the tool run the js function in the side panel and draw on the canvas
4. test and refine
