## Introduce

I want to give copilot more space for collaboration

Create a VSCode extension which hooks in a tool so that copilot can draw on a canvas in a side panel using a js function

## Project name
The project is named `showoff`. use that for any package names etc.

Typescript

### Milestones
1. basic extension which has an activity button which opens a panel
2. Update the panel to show a web page
3. update the webpage to have a canvas and some random shapes
4. register a tool with copilot that takes a js function as arg and prints it to console
5. have the tool run the js function in the side panel and draw on the canvas
6. test and refine
